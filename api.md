RootCloud API
==========

Introduction
===

The RootCloud API is a [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) API.
REST means a lot of things, but first and foremost it means that we use the URL in the way that it's intended:
as a "Uniform Resource Locator".

In this case, the unique "resource" in question is your Oak Board.
Every Oak Board ("board") has a URL, which can be used to `GET` variables, `POST` a function call, or `PUT` new firmware.
The variables and functions that you have written in your firmware are exposed as *subresources* within the Oak Board.

All requests to the Oak Board come through our API server using TLS security.

**Spark API Compatibility:** The RootCloud API has been developed as a completely new codebase in a clean room implementation, but these documents and the API structure are borrowed heavily from the [Spark](http://spark.io) project. While the RootCloud API was originally implmented as an entirely seperate API, the Spark API seemed structured in a way that would work well with the RootCloud devices, so in the interest on compatibility and standards we have built our API to be 99% compatible with the Spark API, while implementing many new features as well. 

**Credit:** Much credit is due to the Spark team! They have created a very logical API implementation for talking to IoT devices, and graciously open sourced their documentation and some of their tools. A huge thanks to them!


```
PROTOCOL AND HOST
https://api.rootcloud.io
```

There are a number of API calls available, which are summarized here, and described in more detail below.

List devices
-------

List devices the currently authenticated user has access to.

```
GET /v1/devices

# A typical JSON response will look like this
[
  {
    "id": "53ff6f0650723",
    "name": "digistump_oak",
    "last_app": null,
    "last_heard": null,
    "connected": false
  },
  {
    "id": "53ff291839887",
    "name": "turtle",
    "last_app": null,
    "last_heard": 2015-02-15T20:12:51.974Z,
    "connected": true
  }
]
```

Claim board/module
-------

You can claim a brand new or released board/module through a simple API call. All you need as an access token and board/module id!

```
POST /v1/devices

# EXAMPLE REQUEST
curl https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices \
     -d access_token=1234 \
     -d id=0123456789abcdef01234567
```

Device information
-------

Get basic information about the given board, including the custom variables and functions it has exposed.

```
GET /v1/devices/{DEVICE_ID}
```

Update the board, including the display name or the firmware (either binary or source).

```
PUT /v1/devices/{DEVICE_ID}
```

Requesting a variable value
-------

Request the current value of a variable exposed by the board,
e.g., `GET /v1/devices/0123456789abcdef01234567/temperature`

```
GET /v1/devices/{DEVICE_ID}/{VARIABLE}
```

Calling a function
-------

Call a function exposed by the board, with arguments passed in request body,
e.g., `POST /v1/devices/0123456789abcdef01234567/brew`

```
POST /v1/devices/{DEVICE_ID}/{FUNCTION}
```

Open a stream of [Server-Sent Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/)

```
GET /v1/events[/:event_name]
GET /v1/devices/events[/:event_name]
GET /v1/devices/{DEVICE_ID}/events[/:event_name]
```


Authentication
-------

Just because you've connected your Oak Board to the internet doesn't mean anyone else should have access to it.
Permissions for controlling and communciating with your Oak Board are managed with OAuth2.

```bash
# You type in your terminal
curl https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices/0123456789abcdef01234567/brew \
     -d access_token=9876987698769876987698769876987698769876
# Response status is 200 OK, which means
# the board says, "Yes ma'am!"

# Sneaky Pete tries the same thing in his terminal
curl https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices/0123456789abcdef01234567/brew \
     -d access_token=1234123412341234123412341234123412341234
# Response status is 403 Forbidden, which means
# the board says, "You ain't the boss of me."

# LESSON: Protect your access token.
```

Your access token can be found in the RootCloud IDE by clicking the "Keys" button on the top button bar.

[RootCloud IDE >](https://ide.rootcloud.io)

When you connect your Oak Board to the Cloud for the first time, it will be associated with your account,
and only you will have permission to control your Oak Boardâ€”using your access token.

~~If you need to transfer ownership of the board to another user, the easiest way is to simply log into the [RootCloud IDE site](https://ide.rootcloud.io), select the device from the drop down "Devices" list and click on the gear next to the drop down. Then click "Release Device". This will make it possible for the other person you are transfering the device to, to go through the normal [claiming process](/#/connect/claiming-your-board).~~ Not yet implemented

In the future, you will be able to provision access to your Oak Board to other accounts
and to third-party app developers; however, these features are not yet available.



### How to send your access token

There are three ways to send your access token in a request.

* In an HTTP Authorization header (always works)
* In the URL query string (only works with GET requests)
* In the request body (only works for POST & PUT when body is URL-encoded)

In these docs, you'll see example calls written using a terminal program called
[curl](http://curl.haxx.se/)
which may already be available on your machine.

Example commands will always start with `curl`.

---

To send a custom header using curl, use you the `-H` flag.
The access token is called a "Bearer" token and goes in the standard
HTTP `Authorization` header.

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 38bb7b318cc6898c80317decb34525844bc9db55"
  https://...
```

---

The query string is the part of the URL after a `?` question mark.
To send the access token in the query string just add `access_token=38bb...`.
Because your terminal thinks the question mark is special, we escape it with a backslash.

```
curl https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices\?access_token=38bb7b318cc6898c80317decb34525844bc9db55
```

---

The request body is how form contents are submitted on the web.
Using curl, each parameter you send, including the access token is preceded by a `-d` flag.
By default, if you add a `-d` flag, curl assumes that the request is a POST.
If you need a different request type, you have to specifically say so with the `-X` flag,
for example `-X PUT`.

```
curl -d access_token=38bb7b318cc6898c80317decb34525844bc9db55
  https://...
```


### Generate a new access token

```
POST /oauth/token

# Using curl in your terminal
curl https://api.rootcloud.io/oauth/token \
     -d grant_type=password -d username=joe@example.com -d password=SuperSecret

# A typical JSON response will look like this
{
    "access_token": "254406f79c1999af65a7df4388971354f85cfee9",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "expires_in": 7776000
}
```

When creating a new access token, you need to specify several additional pieces of info.

You must give a valid client ID and password in HTTP Basic Auth.
**RootCloud Change:** A client ID is not required - but one may be sent, it will be ignored.
In the POST body, you need three parameters:

* grant_type=password
* username=YOUR_EMAIL@ADDRE.SS
* password=YOUR_PASSWORD

### Configure when your token expires

You can control when your access token will expire, or set it to not expire at all!  
There are two ways to specify how / when your token should expire.


####expires_in - Optional

How many seconds should the token last for?  Setting this to 0 seconds will create a token that never expires.

It's generally a little safer to create short lived tokens and refresh them frequently, since it makes it harder to lose a token that has access to your devices.

```
# expires in 3600 seconds, or 1 hour
"expires_in": 3600
```

```
# Setting token lifespan using expires_in with curl in your terminal
curl https://api.rootcloud.io/oauth/token \
     -d grant_type=password \
     -d username=joe@example.com \
     -d password=SuperSecret \
     -d expires_in=3600
```

 
```
 
```

####expires_at - Optional

At what date and time should the token expire?  This should be an ISO8601 style date string, or null for never


```
# date format: YYYY-MM-DD
# expires in 2020
"expires_at": "2020-01-01"
```

```
# Setting token lifespan using a date string with curl in your terminal
curl https://api.rootcloud.io/oauth/token \
     -d grant_type=password \
     -d username=joe@example.com \
     -d password=SuperSecret \
     -d expires_at=2020-01-01
```





### List all your tokens

```
GET /v1/access_tokens

# Using curl in your terminal
curl https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/access_tokens -u joe@example.com:SuperSecret

# Example JSON response
[
    {
        "token": "b5b901e8760164e134199bc2c3dd1d228acf2d98",
        "expires_at": "2014-04-27T02:20:36.177Z",
        "client": "rootcloud"
    },
    {
        "token": "ba54b6bb71a43b7612bdc7c972914604a078892b",
        "expires_at": "2014-04-27T06:31:08.991Z",
        "client": "rootcloud"
    }
]
```

You can list all your access tokens by passing your email address and password
in an HTTP Basic Auth header to `/v1/access_tokens`.


### Deleting an access token

```
DELETE /v1/access_tokens/:token

# Using curl in your terminal
curl https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/access_tokens/b5b901e8760164e134199bc2c3dd1d228acf2d98 \
     -u joe@example.com:SuperSecret -X DELETE

# Example JSON response
{
    "ok": true
}
```

If you have a bunch of unused tokens and want to clean up, you can delete tokens.

Just as for listing them, send your username and password in an HTTP Basic Auth header.


Errors
-------

The RootCloud uses traditional HTTP response codes to provide feedback from the board regarding the validity
of the request and its success or failure. As with other HTTP resources, response codes in the 200 range
indicate success; codes in the 400 range indicate failure due to the information provided;
codes in the 500 range indicate failure within RootCloud's server infrastructure.

```
200 OK - API call successfully delivered to the board and executed.

400 Bad Request - Your request is not understood by the board,
    or the requested subresource (variable/function) has not been exposed.

401 Unauthorized - Your access token is not valid, or you are attempting to do something you do not have permission to do. This is currently used as somewhat of a catch-all response. 

403 Forbidden - Your access token is not authorized to interface with this board.

404 Not Found - The board you requested is not currently connected to the cloud.

408 Timed Out - The cloud experienced a significant delay when trying to reach the board.

500 Server errors - Fail whale. Something's wrong on our end.
```

Versioning
-------

The API endpoints all start with `/v1` to represent the first official version of the RootCloud API.
The existing API is stable, and we may add new endpoints with the `/v1` prefix.

If in the future we make backwards-incompatible changes to the API, the new endpoints will start with
something different, probably `/v2`.  If we decide to deprecate any `/v1` endpoints,
we'll give you lots of notice and a clear upgrade path.

Basic functions
========

Controlling a board
--------

To control a board, you must first define and expose *functions* in the board firmware.
You then call these functions remotely using the RootCloud API. 

Note: If you have declared a function name longer than 12 characters it *will be truncated* to 12 characters. Example: RootCloud.function("someFunction1", ...); exposes a function called **someFunction** and *not* **someFunction1**

```cpp
/* FIRMWARE */
int brew(String args)
{
  // parse brew temperature and duration from args
  // ...

  activate_heating_element(temperature);
  start_water_pump(duration_seconds);

  // int status_code = ...
  return status_code;
}
```

---

Let's say, as an example, you create a Oak powered coffeemaker.
Within the firmware, we might expect to see something like this brew function.

```cpp
/* FIRMWARE */
void setup()
{
  RootCloud.function("brew", brew);
}
```

In a normal coffeemaker, `brew` might be called when a button on the front of the coffeemaker is pressed.

To make this function available through the RootCloud, simply add a `RootCloud.function` call to your `setup()`.



---

This *exposes* the brew function so that it can be called through the API. When this code is present in the firmware, you can make this API call.

```bash
POST /v1/devices/{DEVICE_ID}/{FUNCTION}

# EXAMPLE REQUEST
curl https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices/0123456789abcdef01234567/brew \
     -d access_token=1234123412341234123412341234123412341234 \
     -d "args=202,230"
```

---

The API request will be routed to the Oak Board and will run your `brew` function. The response will have a `return_value` key containing the integer returned by `brew`.

```json
// EXAMPLE RESPONSE
{
  "id": "0123456789abcdef01234567",
  "name": "prototype99",
  "connected": true,
  "return_value": 42
}

```

All RootCloud functions take a String as the only argument and must return a 32-bit integer.
The maximum length of the argument is 63 characters.


Reading data from a board
--------

### Variables

Imagine you have a temperature sensor attached to the A0 pin of your Oak Board
and your firmware has exposed the value of the sensor as a RootCloud variable.

```cpp
/* FIRMWARE */
int temperature = 0;

void setup()
{
  RootCloud.variable("temperature", &temperature, INT);
  pinMode(A0, INPUT);
}

void loop()
{
  temperature = analogRead(A0);
}
```

---

You can now make a `GET` request, even with your browser, to read the sensor at any time.
The API endpoint is `/v1/devices/{DEVICE_ID}/{VARIABLE}` and as always, you have to include your access token.

```bash
# EXAMPLE REQUEST IN TERMINAL
# Device ID is 0123456789abcdef01234567
# Your access token is 1234123412341234123412341234123412341234
curl "https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices/0123456789abcdef01234567/temperature?access_token=1234123412341234123412341234123412341234"
```
And the response contains a `result` like this:

```json
// EXAMPLE RESPONSE
{
  "cmd": "VarReturn",
  "name": "temperature",
  "result": 42,
  "coreInfo": {
    "last_app": "",
    "last_heard": "2014-08-22T22:33:25.407Z",
    "connected": true,
    "deviceID": "53ff6c065075535119511687"
  }

```

**NOTE**: Variable names are truncated after the 12th character: `temperature_sensor` is accessible as `temperature_`

### Events

#### Registering a callback

In the RootCloud IDE, you will be able to register a URL on your own server
to which we will POST each time one of your Oak Boards publishes a certain event. *This feature is still in progress, and will be released by the time the Kickstarter's ship.*

#### Archived event data - RootCloud Data Explorer

A feature unique to the RootCloud API is the ability to specify that an event should be archived, and later retrieve that archived data.

Archived data from your devices can be explored and filtered with the RootCloud Data Explorer: https://data.rootcloud.io The RootCloud Data Explorer provides filtering and drill down capabilities and presents the corresponding REST API URL for the current filter set in use.

You can also access archived data directly from the REST API:

---

Fetch all archived events (optionally matching the event_name), public and private, published by devices one owns:

```
GET /v1/devices/data[/:event_name]

# EXAMPLE
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 38bb7b318cc6898c80317decb34525844bc9db55"
https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices/data/temperature
```

---

Fetch all archived events (optionally matching the event_name), public and private, published by a specific device:

```
GET /v1/devices/:device_id/data[/:event_name]

# EXAMPLE
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 38bb7b318cc6898c80317decb34525844bc9db55"
https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices/55ff70064939494339432586/data/temperature
```

---

Filter the fetching of archived events (optionally matching the event_name) by a start and or end date:

```
GET /v1/devices/data[/:event_name]
or
GET /v1/devices/:device_id/data[/:event_name]

# EXAMPLE
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 38bb7b318cc6898c80317decb34525844bc9db55"
https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices/data/temperature?start=2015-04-19T12:59:23Z&end=2015-04-21T00:00:00Z
```

#### Subscribing to events

You can make an API call that will open a stream of
[Server-Sent Events](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/) (SSEs).
You will make one API call that opens a connection to the RootCloud.
That connection will stay open, unlike normal HTTP calls which end quickly.
Very little data will come to you across the connection unless your Oak Board publishes an event,
at which point you will be immediately notified.

To subscribe to an event stream, make a GET request to one of the following endpoints.
This will open a Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream, i.e., a TCP socket that stays open.
In each case, the event name filter in the URI is optional.  When specifying an event name filter,
published events will be limited to those events with names that begin with the specified string.
For example, specifying an event name filter of 'temp' will return events with names 'temp' and 
'temperature'. 

SSE resources:

* http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events
* http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/eventsource/basics/

---

Subscribe to the firehose of public events, plus private events published by devices one owns:

```
GET /v1/events[/:event_name]

# EXAMPLE
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 38bb7b318cc6898c80317decb34525844bc9db55"
https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/events/temperature
```

---

Subscribe to all events, public and private, published by devices one owns:

```
GET /v1/devices/events[/:event_name]

# EXAMPLE
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 38bb7b318cc6898c80317decb34525844bc9db55"
https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices/events/temperature
```

---

Subscribe to events from one specific device.
If the API user owns the device, then she will receive all events,
public and private, published by that device.
If the API user does not own the device she will only receive public events.

```
GET /v1/devices/:device_id/events[/:event_name]

# EXAMPLE
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 38bb7b318cc6898c80317decb34525844bc9db55"
https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices/55ff70064939494339432586/events/temperature
```

#### Publishing events

You can publish events to your devices using the publish event endpoint.


```
POST /v1/devices/events

# EXAMPLE
curl https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices/events \
     -d access_token=1234123412341234123412341234123412341234 \
     -d "name=myevent" \
     -d "data=Hello World" \
     -d "private=true" \
     -d "ttl=0" \     
     -d "archive=true"      
```

"data", "private", "ttl", and "archive" are all optional.  You can also send these with the RootCloud CLI:

```
# grab the rootcloud-cli here - Not yet available
rootcloud publish test "Hello World"
```


Verifying and Flashing new firmware
---------

All your Oak firmware coding can happen entirely in the RootCloud IDE.
However, if you prefer to use your own text editor or IDE, you can!
It just means that instead of hitting the "Flash" or "Verify" buttons, you'll make API calls that reference a file.


### Flash a board with source code

If you have written a source code file that defines `setup()` and `loop()` functions,
you can flash it to your Oak Board with an HTTP PUT request.

```
# HTTP REQUEST DEFINITION
PUT /v1/devices/{DEVICE_ID}
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

Send the source code file as "file" in request body.
```

---

The API request should be encoded as `multipart/form-data` with a `file` field populated.
Your filename does not matter.  In particular, the extension can be .c, .cpp, .ino, or anything else your prefer.

This API request will submit your firmware to be compiled into a binary, after which,
if compilation was successful, the binary will be flashed to your board wirelessly.

```bash
# EXAMPLE REQUEST IN TERMINAL
# Flash a board with a file called "my-firmware-app.cpp"
curl -X PUT -F file=@my-firmware-app.cpp \
  "https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices/0123456789abcdef01234567?access_token=1234123412341234123412341234123412341234"
```

---

There are three possible response formats:

* A successful response, in which both compilation and flashing succeed.
* A failure due to compilation errors.
* A failure due to inability to transmit the binary to the board.


```js
// EXAMPLE SUCCESSFUL RESPONSE
{
  "ok": true,
  "firmware_binary_id": "12345"
}
```

```js
// EXAMPLE COMPILE FAILURE RESPONSE
{
  "ok": false,
  "errors": ["Compile error"],
  "output": ".... lots of debug output from the compiler..."
}
```

```js
// EXAMPLE FLASH FAILURE RESPONSE
{
  "ok": false,
  "firmware_binary_id": "1234567",
  "errors": ["Device is not connected."]
}
```

### Flash a board with a pre-compiled binary

If you want to compile the firmware yourself and send a binary instead of a source file, you can do that too!
Just add `file_type=binary` to the request body, and we will skip the compilation stage altogether.
The response format will look like those shown above.

```bash
# EXAMPLE REQUEST IN TERMINAL TO FLASH A BINARY
curl -X PUT -F file=@my-firmware-app.bin -F file_type=binary \
  "https://api.rootcloud.io/v1/devices/0123456789abcdef01234567?access_token=1234123412341234123412341234123412341234"
```
